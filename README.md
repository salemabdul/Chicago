# Chicago
I viewed a dataset regarding the chicago census and the chicago schools. I got the dataset from kaggle and I analyzed the dataset using SQL. The variables that I focused on mainly were the school id, name of the school, if the school is healthy school certified, safety score, college enrollment, community area name,  percent of housing crowded, percent of households below poverty, percent of people ages 16 and up unemployed, percent of peoples ages 25 and up without a high school diploma, percent of those aged under 18 or over 64, and per capita income. I found some averages of some of the columns, maximum and minimum of some of the columns, querying, and more.
